(1)I chose this API topic because I always love a good plate of soul food and I would like to share with everyone a nice spot where they can go and get a nice plate of soul food

(2)My API is basically just for a sould food resturant in harlem. The data that's available is the best dish thats sold and the background on the resturant.

(3)My experience was nice because although I had a little bit of a struggle in the beginning when I got the hang of it, it was fun being able to share my skills with other people while showing them something I love.
